Translating the OCDS into your own language is an important step to the adoption of the Standard as well understanding Open Contracting. 

This guide gives a general overview of the ways in which we have learnt to translate OCDS using Transifex. This guide does not cover the exact process to start using Transifex, we recommend that you read the [Using Transifex](http://ocds-standard-development-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard/translation/#using-transifex) bit in the OCDS documentation. 

## Globally replacing a term

Replacing a term on Transifex can be divided in two parts. The first is the agreement with the community or publisher team that works on the translation and second is the actual process of replacing the term. 

### Agreeing on a term

The first step to replace a term globally is using the most neutral term you can find and add it to Transifex. It can happen that a language has variants by region, state or even country sharing the same language. So after this, you need to open the discussion to what each of the terms mean in those contexts. 

If you have a team working with you on the translation of OCDS, it is important to include someone who has knowledge of the procurement rules in your location, as well as someone who knows the techincal bits of your procurement system; this will help you make sure when you're translating you're adhering to the regulations and also the technical team is aware of the changes. 

If you have knowledge of other teams in different countries or cities that may help you in this discussion, reach out to them.
